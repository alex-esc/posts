# Privacy Policy

The website's author does not collect any information from users, however third parties do collect statistics via cookies on this page but _you can easily opt out_ or block information collecting scripts or cookies.

**Third parties who collect data:** fontawsome and Bootstrap are used in our website to provide _icons and buttons_, both companies share the same [privacy policy](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/privacy-policy/), they collect analytics to determine what icons are the most popular.

**How to opt out of third party data collection:** since the icons are not necessary to use our website you can block them without losing any functionality, to block them use [noscript](https://github.com/hackademix/noscript/) or [ublock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) origin. Alternatively we provide a light version of our website that does not use fontawsome or Bootstrap whatsoever: [digital-rights.github.io/light](https://digital-rights.github.io/light/).
