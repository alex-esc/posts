title: "For a more social mastodon.social we need to open up the fediverse"

The old Internet, responsible for child-like wonder and fun, is long gone. Now a few key players own [the means of our social lives online][1], but our need for company & community far exceeds the strength of our chains to centralized platforms. <!--more-->Today we find ourselves being truly social, social on any territory or space - that's what people do best, adapt to their surroundings.

Right now the poster-child for independent, grassroots, humane peer to peer and decentralized social media is Mastodon. My fascination with this platform lies on it's potential more than it's current implementation. Consider this post an open letter to developers around the world, a call to action for a people's internet. Here is my utopian vision for a soon to come new age Internet Renaissance:

## Approach

This is a mediated exchange, right now I am pressing my fingers against a keyboard and you are looking though a screen. It is therefore very easy to get lost inside a medium; when using a VR headset and controllers for the first time your brain instantly stops thinking about the controller your hands are holding, the buttons and triggers your fingers are pulling and pushing, the soft texture of the headset's foam rubbing against your forehead and the weight of the device slowly drifting your head downward; when you text on your phone the interface disappears like the VR equipment, you become one with the other person, ignoring the screen you're taping in fast succession, the software keyboard itself, the weight and shape of the device, it all becomes secondary.

This state of flow is what most app developers crave for, thus trapping themselves into a different medium. Just like users get so lost and abstract into actions rather than mediated interactions with a medium, developers tend to find themselves fully immersed in a realm of technicisms. I do not mean to say that one approach to a mediums is better than another, but that to become aware of this trenches can help us identify when a discussion lays on what side of the coin.

By pure chance I have been present during various discussions about social technology, and the two camps sometimes seem to forget their unison. After all the banter and back & forth discussion, developers, visionaries, community members and users have a shared goal. It is crucial this goal remains clear, for this purpose I will approach this plan with a birds eye. Rather than adopting the technical terms of the programmers or the colloquial lingo of the users I will explain my vision with it's own language, not focused specifically on code nor culture, but on spacial design, urban planing and abstract ideas based on analogies and comparisons with the real world social sphere. For a moment forget you're a user or programmer, forget your technical methods or end user actions, and focus instead on the medium and the medium alone. Regardless of implementation or user experience, what kind of medium do we want?

## Objectives

We're talking social here.
