Yeah! turns out I am multiple online profiles.

Hi I'm Alex Escalante, but I go by many user-names, mainly Alex Esc. as a wired abbreviation of my real name, the "esc" has a really computer-y & Internet-y feel to it so I went with it.

Recently I decided to change all my user-names to `alex-esc` if possible, if the name was already in use I will choose one with an underscore or a point instead of a dash, but regardless of my Internet identity problem identifying users is a real issue.

How can you be sure that `notascam@gmail.com` is really a Nigerian prince? can you trust anyone online? even random bulletin board members, Facebook profiles or journalists? Your friends and family are easy to trust online because we know them face to face. It was your best friend who gave you the phone number you chat with, once you know each time you text that specific number you are talking with him and him only.

But on the Internet you don't know if a random user is who he claims to be without some kind of verification, enter keybase.

Keybase is a platform that verifies Internet users via access to physical devices and social media accounts, for example if you head over [my keybase profile][kb] you will see that whoever alexesc is he has access to Alex Escalante's website, GitHub account, Reddit account, Twitter handle and two physical devices, now the case for my identity is very compelling since I have that keybase profile to prove it.


## Other Internet accounts

I am `alex-esc` at GitHub, my current Reddit account is `alex_esc`, my old Reddit account was `jet_so`, my old Twitter was `@jet_so` and my mastodon.social is `@jet_so`.
