Discussions about privacy that take place online can become abstract, philosophical and strange for someone casually passing by. Community outsiders feel so alien to the conversation. We all were, to some degree, internet-privacy-unconscious at some point, still we sometimes [forget what it felt like to be on the other side of the fence][1]. Outsiders think we're obsessive in our levels of privacy, how do we respond to this common sentiment? With a [Snowden quote][2] ... But let's say for the sake of argument that they are right and we don't have something to hide. Are they right then? Are we unhealthily obsessing over spinning hard drives?

I've been a part of the privacy community on several mediums. I've been on boards, forms, subreddits, mailing lists and group chats, but the points in favor or opposition remain the same inside our eco-chambers - we are so cartoonsihly predictable that recently I made a [bingo card][3] out of a [privacy chat group on Telegram][4]. One line of thought that keeps bouncing back is that, unlike the yuppies would argue, you do have something to hide. On privacytools.io's official twitter profile I found this post:
