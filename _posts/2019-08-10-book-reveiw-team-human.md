title: "Team Human by Douglas Rushkoff - Book Review"

As technology advances we remain the same imperfect, biased and angry humans. But if our tools start using us, then how will we survive? Media Theorist Douglas Rushkoff thinks that we can only survive as a species by acknowledging our species itself; as a team rather than individuals: Team Human. <!--more-->

# My journey to find the book & the others

For a long time I've been frustrated with so called *"Internet intellectuals"*, very little things on the net come close to the cathartic feeling of listening to a talk and slowly realizing the big picture idea being but forth by the speaker. The topic I usually always came around to listen to another debate, podcast or conference about one particular topic: Religion. At the beginning there was *[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey][1]*, hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson, this show was recommended to me via my Netflix feed, probably because of my obsession for *2001: A Space Odyssey* and everything Stanley Kubrick (If you enjoy 2001 as much as I do, you might want to [check out this](#Something-interesting-about-Kubrick's-2001)). I loved Tyson's Cosmos, It spoke to my teenage self like a powerful movie spoke to me, this was a very emotional appeal. Other documentaries seemed more preoccupied with digesting and presenting information than with communicating a more grandiose message: the beauty of science and the cosmos.

After watching the series I felt like I stood on the shoulders of giants, like there's something to gain, a goal to be fought for. But instead of seeing this uplifting emotion as a call to action for perusing science I fell on an Internet rabbit hole - as per usual. I searched the web for other people's opinion about the series, hoping I would find a key point or a nuanced take on the series, what I got instead was an open door towards becoming an asshole atheist. I came across YouTube user-name *the amazing atheist* and his video titled *[Idiots React To Cosmos][2]*, on it a somewhat young man wearing a t-shirt that says "fiction" in the [Coexist bumper sticker][3] font ranted about how religious people, but especially Christians, are too dumb to understand Cosmos, science and the world at large.

Like many people around the 2016 USA election period my discovery of the skeptic community on YouTube sent me down a pipeline. Without me knowing the process I want through, I became a "skeptic": I would look at the world with the lens of science, facts and logic and question everything in the name of finding the truth - but the enlightenment was so close as to blind me entirely. For the first time I felt on a path towards intellectualism, my thought leaders and think tanks would present me an argument for me to endlessly dissect with thorough precision and rigor, the dynamic went like this: I would find a YouTube video or a Reddit post criticizing an idea, then I would consume the media criticism, think about the counter arguments presented and - nearly all occasions - come to the same concussion of the video or post. Once doing all the work taking in the ideas and counter points I felt accomplished, as if I had made a discovery that would place me closer to enlightenment. One of the main problems was the topics to tackle, I didn't get to choose them, they were chosen by other skeptics and the YouTube recommendations algorithm. Right about this time I took some philosophy and critical thinking classes, I felt proud on them, the teachers would congratulate my reasoning, my grades went up, other students dog-whistled their skeptic status and I felt a sense of belonging to a group of highly educated individuals amongst the campus.

YouTube's implementation of video recommendations was a curse disguised as blessing; every day, every hour, every five minutes a new video was ready to be watched. This slowly pushed me towards hotter and hotter takes. Since I was a child I have given for granted that God and religion are allegories and serve as a baseline for morality - not because I'm a boy genius, but because It was thought by my parents in that manner. In my childhood God remained as real as life itself; his existence was true, but his outcome was practical rather than supernatural. Watching highly opinionated atheist videos in my early adolescence changed this perspective, now God served no purpose and to believe in him was to reject science, facts and logic - but the only thing I gave my back to were other people. I would *logical-fallacy* my way out of friends and relationships, science and facts became a monolithic weapon to destroy other people with. Once I burned all bridges with my theists ex-friends something tribal happened: I lost an enemy. However this was not synonymous with victory, rather it was a reflection of becoming desperately angry at something, at whatever really. Thousands of anti-theists videos later came the anti-feminist videos; a new mythology was laying right in front of my very eyes. Now there's the Social Justice Warriors (or SJW's for short), the fake feminists, the biology-hating Tumblr users on one side, and on my side there's Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and science itself.

The years went by and my view points got more and more extreme. After years of listening to YouTube skeptics like in [apple's 1984 commercial][4] I had become a digital zombie. My system developed anti-bodies for "feminist propaganda", "SJW rhetoric" and religious imagery, I would find meaning were there was none in my everyday life and in popular media: A character in the new Star Wars film has pink hair; *feminist propaganda*, a friend came out as pansexual; that's blatant *Tumblr indoctrination*. I was chained to the YouTube algorithm nearly to the point of no return, but I began to see my way out when a popular anti-SJW video creator, Chris Ray Gun, [released a video titled *ANTI-SJWs HATE HIM! - Glasses Of*][5]. In said video Chris talks about his fans thinking he is not anti-SJW enough, still he condones both sides while obviously preferring the right and pretending to be left, regardless. Chris did not turn his back on the right wing anti-SJW's, he just

## Something interesting about Kubrick's 2001

My best friend is a chess-head (chess fanatic, *chessophile*? whatever!) and as a Kubrick fan I'm vaguely aware that there's something interesting behind the chess game between *Frank Poole* and *HAL 9000*. I've also heard on an audio interview with Kubrick that he enjoys chess and was really good at it, but I never gave it more thought than that. Until one day, chatting with my mate, the matter came about. We searched the web for an explanation behind the chess game, found this [Wikipedia article][fr-1-1], but most important was our finding of this YouTube video: *[Hotel room ending in 2001: A Space Odyssey recreates Frank Poole vs. HAL 9000 chess moves][fr-1-2]* by Anton Halldin.

The video goes into detail about how the chess game parallels the upcoming events in the movie, while it may seem like a stretch it's interesting nonetheless and a cool underground YouTube find. If you dig 2001 analysis as much as I do, you might enjoy [his other videos][fr-1-3]. If you still can't get enough Space Odyssey in your life the author of the video wrote this document titled: *[5001, Symbolism in Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey][fr-1-4]*. This document is a goldmine worth digging, & if you're on the economical position to donate to [the author's Patreaon account][fr-1-5] you really should. You can fall further down a Kubrick rabbit hole on Anton Halldin's website all bout his document: *[www.space5001odyssey.com][fr-1-6]*.
