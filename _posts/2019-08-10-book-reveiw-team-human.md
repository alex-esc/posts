For a long time I've been frustrated with so called *"Internet intellectuals"*, very little things on the net come close to the cathartic feeling of listening to a talk and slowly realizing the big picture idea being but forth by the speaker. The topic I usually always came around to listen to another debate, podcast or conference about one particular topic: Religion. At the beginning there was *Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey*, hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson, this show was recommended to me via my Netflix feed, probably because of my obsession for *2001: A Space Odyssey* and everything Stanley Kubrick.[cool stuff about kubric](### kubric sruff)
