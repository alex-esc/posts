For a long time I've been frustrated with so called *"Internet intellectuals"*, very little things on the net come close to the cathartic feeling of listening to a talk and slowly realizing the big picture idea being but forth by the speaker. The topic I usually always came around to listen to another debate, podcast or conference about one particular topic: Religion. At the beginning there was *Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey*, hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson, this show was recommended to me via my Netflix feed, probably because of my obsession for *2001: A Space Odyssey* and everything Stanley Kubrick.

# Introduction to V-cards.
Keeping in touch with old fiends can be a major pain, your closest friends might be on facebook but your old coworker is on telegram, your grandparents don’t bother with technology non-scene and you can only contact them on the phone.

Every service or company like facebook, Gmail, Outlook and your smart-phone are competing for being the most convenient way of keeping in touch, this endless competitions only serves to fragment your contact list. All your work contacts are on some old email account, your old college friends are somewhere in a FB group. In other words no service is truly convenient.

If you could only go back to the old days of writing down phone numbers and emails on a reliable sheet of paper everything would be better! right? well… Old school address books are inconvenient if you have to keep them in a bag somewhere handy at all times, we can do better: V-cards are what you are looking for.

V-cards are simple, small files. Easy to store on a USB stick or backed up in the cloud and they can store each and every single one of your contacts in one safe and easy to read place. That means all your facebook contacts, your smarphone address book and old emails in one place.

Will V-cards work on my device?
Yes, they are a standard since the 90’s. They work on Windows computers, Apple computers, iPhones, Androids. The list goes on and on, even back to supporting dumb phones like Nokia’s and Blackberry’s

V-cards are as compatible and universal as it gets, services like facebook, gmail, android and iOS probably use them on the back end.

# Can I trust them?
Of course you can! V-cards are safe in the sense that they are simple plain text files that you create yourself, they will not compromise you to any computer virus like downloading a random program on the Internet will because v-cards are made and manged by you, not a random person from the Internet.

They are private in the sense that they are stored in your device and nowhere else. Other methods like using Google contacts, Facebook in general, the contacts app on your phone are always looking any changes you make, they do this out of good will to provide cloud services but the problem is that they store your private information on their insecure servers. Remember the iCloud leaks? see, apple services are not to be trusted! Google, Yahoo and Facebook use similar security measures that could be compromised in the future. Likewise they are not to be trusted.

# According to the New York Times:

Back in 2014 hackers stole private information of over 500 million users from yahoo servers, including contact information like their full names, addresses, telephone numbers and passwords.

What is a V-card and how to read and understand them?
So what are v-cards? well they are made in plain text for easy reading this files end in .vcf (short for v card file) and they read very much like and old school address book. For example: lets say I want to store the phone numbers of King Kong and Mario Bros, in that case I want something like this:

first contact begins here


king kong

cellphone number is 123...

first contact ends here

second contact begins here

mario bros

home phone is 321..

second contact ends here

etc
We are writing this because we actually mean what’s shown in the image below:

What you mean

If you look at them side by side its very easy to see the correlation because people understand address books and the concept of phone numbers, but computers are really dumb, they are truly stupid.

big dumb dumb

So we have to hold their hand and explain them what we want them to do in the simplest way possible, meaning we have to write some code. Don’t worry, this code will be super simple, no fancy variables or programing, none of that just simple code that you can easily understand and read out loud to anyone without any confusion.

This is why instead of writing in the “first contact begins here” format we will write some very simple code, we will write:

(using capital letters on the code is necessary)
