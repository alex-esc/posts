title: "Do privacy advocates really care about privacy?"
---

It seems there has been a paradigm shift in privacy activism; we went from protesting digital injustices in the name of privacy, autonomy and freedom of speech to reacting without autonomy, freedom of speech, or even privacy, to the same injustices we used to protest.

This reversal of values has been floating around my head for some time now, I wrote [this blog post][1] about it, originally it was a thread on the [humane technology community forum][2]. It was written as a response to another forum thread titled *I Have to Get Facebook for College*; in it the original poster commented how Facebook has a big grip on student's life and work-flow, she also asked for tips to avoid Facebook's undesirable "features" such as advertising and surveillance. I wrote your typical tech-head response: *You need to install this, run this browser extension, setup this, configure that* - But then I realized how complicit this type of advice I'm giving, this was a [reactionary][3] response.

My post on the humane tech forum sparked some controversy, commenter's immune systems seemed to be resisting some sort of disease. Their almost automatic response cached my eye, not because it shows some kind of fatal flaw in their character, it doesn't, it shows they are human; but we're all human. The particular human mindset on the humane tech forum being in full display here is a strange mindset to be juxtaposed with humanity. Tristan Harris, head of the center of humane technology which brought to life the very same forum I posted my thoughts in, has a very sincere heart, listen to [his podcast][4] or some of [his interviews][5] and you'll see it for yourself.

If the people behind the [tech-lash][6], like Tristan Harris or internet users on Reddit's privacy community, seem so genuine then what's the problem? Don't we need some sort of counter-cultural balance against big corporations doing injustices on a digital media landscape? Isn't this what some tech enthusiast like myself would want out of a movement?

Well, yes, this sort of movement is exactly the kind someone inside my demographic would desire - this is exactly the problem at hand: the boxes we're being drawn inside of.

On July 14th [Donald Trump][7] tweeted the following:

> So interesting to see “Progressive” Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from **countries** whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the **United States**, the greatest and most powerful **Nation** on earth, how our government is to be run. **Why don’t they go back** and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough. I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!

Trump never fails to deliver reactionary talking points, on this tweet he endlessly goes after other countries, nations and territories as if they were facts of nature, as if they have always been there and always will. As if they were just more than *lines drawn on a map*; there has been a reversal, the map has become the territory.

Go back to "shithole" countries? I thought Trump wanted America to be a nation of winners! Trump marketed himself as someone capable of turning a country around, he said that's what the USA needed, make America great again right? If the United States needs people like that, like Trump claims to be, then why is trump condemning people like that? Wouldn't it be better if more people capable of change stay in your country? How are they gonna' win once all the winners are gone for good? 


Yet again, go back to where exactly? other lines drawn withing a map! We made them up, there not real. If you actually go to the border to sympathize with "dirty immigrants" you'd see the wall separates nothing; the barb-wire fence might be present, but so are the people and culture regardless of arbitrary lines on a map, the cultural bond stays.

Why would someone come to such backwards conclusions? If Trump supporters really cared for economic strength then why wouldn't they embrace more people in the workforce providing with cheap labor? And why is *going back to the good old days* the ultimate contusion of this logic?

Because the initial premise isn't true, either because it's a false belief or wrong statement or the true intentions lie somewhere else; make america great again [serves as a symbol][9], it's not Trump's true motto but it functions like it is to hide blatant racism behind economic intentions. The needs to outcast, classify, quantify and analyze as data points on an Excel spreadsheet are being [canonized][10] by our digital technologies. Our desire to abstract away the people we presuppose as *"the others"* has always been with us, for as long as humankind has been around some of us have demonized one another to justify injustices, but today our racism and misogyny have already been systematized: First in the form of racial segregation and an unequal workplace, but now with algorithmic bias, scientific racism and the systematically cold *on/off-us/them* ideology ingrained into our digital devices.

My observations in the privacy community lead me to believe that our group has fallen into this very same trap. Privacy minded folks tend to mock *"the others"*, fetishize a pre-Internet society and - in a very Trump-ian way - undermine the goals and values they claim to champion.

Here are some real examples that cached my eye. On Reddit's sub-section of privacy enthusiasts *r/privacy* I found a user asking how could he remove himself from the Web completely, here's the most up-voted answer:

	1. Die.
	2. Submit proof of death to all sites where you had accounts.

The joke-like subversion of expectations aside, this comment shines a light into the deep rooted tech pessimism within the community. ON that very same post some other user simply replayed with:

	Unplug your internet

Oh, the Irony! Turns out the *command-line-loving-Linux-only-FOSS-super-tech-savvy* people don't like their technologies! They would rather quit the Net than to write the code necessary to fix it. 

It also seems like we don't really care for *capital P Privacy*, when it comes to avoiding digital surveillance the privacy community acts with ego. Rather than fighting for everyone's right for (*capital P*) Privacy, each one of us fights for their own right to isolate themselves from the world; we seem to care for privacy *with an uncapitalized p*, meaning we care for privacy only in the terms of superficial aesthetics.

Our individual and atheistic understanding of privacy has, in some extreme cases, lead "privacy-woke people" to spy on others to protect themselves. With great irony, some people violate other's right to privacy in the name of their own. The following is a real conversation on a public privacy Telegram group:

	User A:
	What can I do when my family keeps posting pictures of me on facebook ?
	I've told them numerous times I don't want to appear there regardless
	of context but they are morons when it comes to that

	User B:
	Put a key logger on their phone and delete the pictures once uploaded

	User B:
	Did that with my family

	User B:
	Have all their social media

	User A:
	Well pointless

	User B:
	Ok

	User A:
	Facebook gets the data if it gets uploaded

	User A:
	But I like the ideea

	User A:
	😈

	User B:
	I bet Mark Zuckerberg is masturbating to your images

	User A:
	I'm sure of it dude

	Me:
	I hope you're kidding
