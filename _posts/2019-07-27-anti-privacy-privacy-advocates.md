It seems there has been a paradigm sift in privacy activism, 

	Weepes:
	What can I do when my family keeps posting pictures of me on facebook ?
	I've told them numerous times I don't want to appear there regardless
	of context but they are morons when it comes to that

	Linux shaggy:
	Put a key logger on their phone and delete the pictures once uploaded
	
	Did that with my family
	
	Have all their social media

	Weepes:
	Well pointless

	Linux shaggy:
	Ok

	Weepes:
	Facebook gets the data if it gets uploaded
	
	But I like the ideea
	
	ðŸ˜ˆ

	Linux shaggy:
	I bet Mark Zuckerberg is masturbating to your images

	Weepes:
	I'm sure of it dude

	Alex Esc:
	I hope you're kidding
