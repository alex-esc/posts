	What can I do when my family keeps posting pictures of me on facebook ?
	I've told them numerous times I don't want to appear there regardless
	of context but they are morons when it comes to that

	Linux shaggy:
	Put a key logger on their phone and delete the pictures once uploaded

	Linux shaggy:
	Did that with my family

	Linux shaggy:
	Have all their social media

	Weepes:
	Well pointless

	Linux shaggy:
	Ok

	Weepes:
	Facebook gets the data if it gets uploaded

	Weepes:

	Weepes:

	Linux shaggy:
