There's this idea in the privacy movement that if you as an individual use software that respects your personal privacy then the game ends and you win.<!--more-->

But as may people that have gone down the privacy rabbit-hole can testify: There's no end, no cut off point to protecting your privacy.

For much of the articles on privacy out there or the many walls of text written in the deepest of comment sections on r/privacy something is clear about the privacy movement: Privacy is for the individual.

Things can easily run amok from this point, you are supposed to quit social media, but that wont be enough, so the you quit your proprietary operating system, blobs are still present so you go full FOSS, but still certain aspects of your everyday life remain on the table.

That means only cash, no reward cards, no ride sharing, no maps, no messaging friends or family, now they can only reach you on the phone, that's of course until you cut the phone cord. You go deeper and deeper but you never reach the point of safety.

PRISM still is looming in the background, it seems the only way is out. Quit this, uninstall that, replace what you just installed because it's problematic. Who really knows if you're safe! The only way to find out is to go even deeper.

Going full unaboomer in the woods feels like the only answer, no technology. Now I can finally feel protected because there's noting left to protect.

Happy now?

Something happened here, it's all really strange. How come protecting your digital privacy lead you to quiting your digital privacy?

You might say that I'm exaggerating, that not everyone ends up in the woods. But even moderate people - at least moderate by privacy advocates standards - end up quiting their digital privacy to a great extend.

A "moderate position" still involves quiting popular apps, messengers used by non paranoid people, social media, and embracing anonymity. In other words, for the vast majority of the privacy community, privacy means to quit and replace stuff, to run away.

Is this tale we tale ourselves about privacy effective or useful? What's our master plan? Are we all supposed to independently take the privacy tech-pill and independently from one another install brave, then replace it with firefox, then replace it with Tor? and to what end?

Think of all the wasted time, human energy, all the labor needed to keep your phone running, all the energy and carbon used up to power some libre-blockchain-open-source-P2P-disruptive fantasy.

Is this the rout to take? are we supposed to end surveillance capitalism by sporting market solutions?

It's a hole lot like environmentalism if you ask me. Is buying eco friendly products rather than normal products gonna solve anything? Rejecting plastic straws looks a hole lot like rejecting proprietary technology to me.

The market tells us that the environment can only be saved from the consequences of consumption by consuming different products crated by the same market. When it comes to privacy we act the same: The market tells us that the consequences of adopting technology without giving it much though can only be solved by adopting some other technology.

This problem stems from our initial presupposition, we begun thinking that privacy is individualistic and therefore the only solutions available involve isolation in some form or another. But what if it's the other way around, what if privacy is a collective goal?

What if instead of digging ourselves deeper into isolation by compart
